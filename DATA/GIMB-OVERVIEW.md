## What is GIMB?

**GIMB** = **G**andhidham **I**ndustrial & **M**aritime **B**usiness Network

*Just like GIMB JN is Gandhidham's railway code, gimb.in is Gandhidham's digital trade code.*

GIMB is a **B2B platform** that digitizes how trade actually happens in port-driven economies — starting with **Kutch District**, centered on **Gandhidham (GIMB) and Kandla Port**, one of India's busiest trade corridors.

## Why This Works

### 🏆 Competitive Moats

* **Data moat**: Reputation, history, performance
* **Trust moat**: Hard to replicate once earned
* **Network moat**: More users = more value

### 🎯 Why Kutch First?

* Kandla: India's largest cargo port by volume
* Mundra: India's largest private port
* ₹50,000+ Cr annual trade value in district
* Underserved by technology
* Dense business network (10,000+ trade entities)
* High transaction frequency
* Gandhidham is the commercial hub of Kutch

## What GIMB is NOT

* ❌ Not a generic business directory
* ❌ Not a social network
* ❌ Not a logistics company
* ❌ Not a lender
* ❌ Not built on AI hype

**GIMB is boring, reliable infrastructure — exactly what trade needs.**
