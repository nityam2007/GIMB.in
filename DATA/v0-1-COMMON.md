GIMB BUSINESS
Kutch's Trusted Business & Trade Network

One place to find real businesses, reliable agents, and port updates — without brokers, confusion, or guesswork.

What problem does GIMB solve? (In plain words)

If you do business in Kutch — Gandhidham, Kandla, Bhuj, Mundra, or anywhere in the district — you already know this:

Finding the right CHA is difficult

Business lists are outdated or fake

Everyone depends on WhatsApp forwards

Port updates are scattered

You don’t know who to trust until something goes wrong

GIMB fixes this by putting verified local trade information in one place.

What is GIMB BUSINESS (V0)?

GIMB is a trusted online directory + information hub for trade businesses.

Nothing fancy.
Nothing complicated.
Just correct, local, usable information.

What can you do on GIMB (V0)?
✅ Find verified businesses

Search and discover:

Exporters & Importers

Logistics & transport companies

Warehouses

Consultants

Customs House Agents (CHAs)

With:

Contact details

Services offered

Area of operation

Years of experience

No random numbers. No outdated lists.

✅ Find reliable CHAs (most important)

For the first time, CHAs are listed with:

What work they handle

What cargo they specialize in

Feedback from real local businesses

This helps you avoid:

Delays

Documentation mistakes

Bad agents

✅ See Kandla Port updates in one place

Instead of checking 5 websites or WhatsApp groups, GIMB shows:

Ship arrivals & departures

Delays & port notices

Important operational updates

So you can plan better.

✅ Decide who to trust

Every business profile shows:

Verification status

Completeness of information

Activity level

This makes it easier to judge who is serious.

What GIMB does NOT do (yet)

To keep things simple and trustworthy, V0 does NOT include:

Online payments

Bidding or tenders

Chat or messaging

Ads spam

Social media features

Those come later.
Right now, trust comes first.

Who should use GIMB?

If you are:

An exporter or importer

A manufacturer

A logistics or transport operator

A CHA

A trade consultant

GIMB is made for you.

If you deal with Kandla Port, this is your new reference point.

Why should businesses list themselves?

Because:

Customers can find you directly

You control your information

You build credibility

You reduce unnecessary calls and confusion

Being listed on GIMB means:

“I am a real, active business in Gandhidham.”

Why people will trust GIMB

Local focus (not all-India noise)

Manual verification

No fake reviews

No paid rankings in V0

Built specifically for Kutch

This is not Google.
This is Kutch. This is Gandhidham. This is Kandla.

Simple example

Instead of asking:

“Do you know a good CHA?”

You can say:

“Check GIMB.”

That’s the goal.

How GIMB grows (without disturbing you)

Starts with Gandhidham-Kandla, expands across Kutch

Grows carefully, not fast

Adds features only when businesses ask for them

No sudden changes.
No experiments with your data.

Kutch first. Always.

The long-term vision (short & honest)

Today:
👉 Trusted directory & port info

Tomorrow:
👉 Business leads, collaboration, shared resources

Later:
👉 Payments, credit access, trade intelligence

But everything starts with trust.
And everything stays in Kutch.
