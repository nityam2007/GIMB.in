# GIMB BUSINESS — V0 DATA SPEC

### (Foundation & Trust Layer)

---

## 1. Purpose of V0

**V0 exists to answer one question perfectly:**

> “Who operates in the Gandhidham–Kandla trade ecosystem, and who can I trust?”

If V0 does this well, **everything else becomes possible**.

---

## 2. Geographic Scope (Hard Limit)

V0 is strictly limited to **Kutch District**, with primary focus on:

**Primary (Core Focus):**
* Gandhidham (GIMB)
* Kandla Port

**Secondary (Kutch Region):**
* Adipur
* Bhuj
* Mundra
* Anjar

No expansion outside Kutch. This constraint is intentional.
Gandhidham-Kandla remains the epicenter.
