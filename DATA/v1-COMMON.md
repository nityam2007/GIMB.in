# GIMB BUSINESS — V1

### Simple Language for Everyone

---

## What is V1?

**V1 is when GIMB becomes a place to do business, not just look up businesses.**

In V0, you could find people.
In V1, you can work with them.

---

## What problem does V1 solve?

Right now, if you need something for your trade:

* You ask 10 people on WhatsApp
* You get random quotes with no comparison
* You don't know who is serious
* Deals happen, but nothing is tracked

**V1 fixes this.**

Post what you need → Get real quotes → Pick the best one → Done.

---

## What can you do on GIMB V1?

### ✅ Post your requirements (RFQ)

Need a CHA for export? Looking for a truck? Want a warehouse?

**Post it on GIMB.**

* Describe what you need
* Set your budget (optional)
* Get responses from verified businesses

No more calling 10 people. Let them come to you.

---

### ✅ Respond to opportunities

If you're a CHA, transporter, or service provider:

* See relevant requirements posted by local businesses
* Send your quote directly
* Win business without cold calling

---

### ✅ Compare quotes easily

All quotes come in one place:

* Price
* Terms
* Delivery time
* Business profile

Compare and decide. No confusion.

---

### ✅ Track your deals

When you close a deal through GIMB:

* Both parties know
* Feedback gets recorded
* Your reputation builds

---

### ✅ Get notified about leads

If someone posts a requirement that matches your services:

**GIMB tells you.**

No need to keep checking. The work comes to you.

---

### ✅ Better CHA ratings

In V1, CHA ratings become richer:

* Timeliness
* Documentation accuracy
* Communication
* Problem resolution
* Value for money

Real feedback from real transactions.

Especially useful for:

* CHAs looking for more clients
* Transporters with available trucks
* Warehouses with spare capacity
* Consultants seeking projects
* Exporters/Importers needing regular services

---

## What V1 does NOT do (yet)

To keep things simple:

* ❌ No payments through GIMB (comes in V2)
* ❌ No resource sharing (comes in V2)
* ❌ No credit/loans (comes in V2)
* ❌ No AI magic (maybe later)

One step at a time.

## How is V1 different from WhatsApp groups?

| WhatsApp | GIMB V1 |
|----------|---------|
| Random forwards | Structured requirements |
| No verification | Verified businesses only |
| No comparison | Easy quote comparison |
| Nothing saved | Everything tracked |
| Spam | No spam |

---

## Simple example

**Before V1:**

You need a CHA for a rice export.
You ask in 3 WhatsApp groups.
You get 7 random names.
You call each one.
You get different quotes verbally.
You pick one based on gut feeling.

**With V1:**

You post: "Need CHA for rice export, 2 containers, Kandla Port"
5 verified CHAs respond with structured quotes.
You compare: price, experience, ratings.
You pick the best one.
Done in 30 minutes.

---

## The one-line pitch

**GIMB V1: Post what you need. Get real quotes. Do business.**

---

## What's next after V1?

**V2: Resources, Payments, and Credit**

* Share warehouses and trucks
* Track invoices and payments
* Get credit-ready

But first, V1 needs to work perfectly.
