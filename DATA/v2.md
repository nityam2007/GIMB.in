# GIMB BUSINESS — V2 DATA SPEC

### (Resource, Payments & Capital Layer)

---

## 1. Purpose of V2

**V2 exists to answer one question perfectly:**

> "How can I run my trade operations more efficiently through GIMB?"

V2 transforms GIMB from a **transaction platform** into **trade infrastructure**.

---

## 2. Prerequisites for V2

V2 only launches after V1 achieves:

* ≥ 200 RFQs per month (sustained)
* ≥ 100 paying subscribers
* ≥ 50 deals closed via platform
* Strong retention (60%+ monthly active)
* Revenue sustainability proven

Without V1 transactions, V2 infrastructure won't be trusted.
