## 🚀 What is GIMB?

**GIMB** = **G**andhidham **I**ndustrial & **M**aritime **B**usiness Network

> *Just like GIMB JN is Gandhidham's railway code, gimb.in is Gandhidham's digital trade code.*

GIMB is a **B2B platform** that digitizes how trade actually happens in port-driven economies — starting with **Kutch District**, centered on **Gandhidham (GIMB) and Kandla Port**, one of India's busiest trade corridors.
